**Instructions:**

Users sign in through their google accounts, and Firebase handles the authentication, so all personal data is secure. Once signed in, users will provide their preferred name and phone number.

Get started by creating a goal. Select a goal name, what the activity of that goal is, and what time you’d like to be reminded. Each day at that time, you’ll get a text from us (standard messaging rates may apply).

Example, let’s say you want to take better care of your teeth, and to do that, you need to floss daily. Well, you can create a goal called ‘Floss Daily.’ The activity will be ‘flossing,’ and lastly you’ll select a time by which you’ll like to receive a reminder (let’s say 10pm). At 10pm, you’ll get reminder from us on your phone to floss!

Track your progress by logging in and track each time you floss, don’t worry, we’ll take care of the analysis for you and display your data in the current progress tab.
